# ipl_score_prediction
this is the machine learning model which predicts the a final score a tema can score in specific match input parameter are listed below
* bat_team - batting team 
* bowl_team = bowling team
* batsman = name of the player currently on strike
* bowler = name of the player currently bowling
* runs = runs scored by batsman for particular ball

* wickets_last_5=wickets in last 5 over w.r.t to that ball
* striker =runs scored by stricker
* non_striker=run scored by non striker <br/>
best fitted algorithm is Linear Regression and buil web app using the Flask (python) <br/>
